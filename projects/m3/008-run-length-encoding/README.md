# Run-Length Encoding

Write a recursive function that implements the run-length compression technique described in Run-Lenght Decoding Exercise. 

Your function will take a list or a string as its only argu- ment. It should return the run-length compressed list as its only result. 

Include a main program that reads a string from the user, compresses it, and displays the run-length
encoded result.

Hint: You may want to include a loop inside the body of your recursive function.
