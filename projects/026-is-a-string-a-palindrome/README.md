# Is a String a Palindrome?

A string is a palindrome if it is identical forward and backward.    
For example “anna”, “civic”, “level” and “hannah” are all examples of palindromic words. 

Write a program that **reads a string from the user** and **uses a loop to determine whether it is a palindrome**. 
Display the result, including a meaningful output message.

"Aibohphobia" is the extreme or irrational fear of palindromes.   
This word was constructed by prepending the -phobia suffix with its reverse, resulting in a palindrome.   

"Ailihphilia" is the fondness for or love of palindromes.  
It was constructed in the same manner from the -philia suffix.

Example:  
Input: cat  
Output:  cat is not a palindrome

Input: wow  
Output: wow is a palindrome
