# Checking for a Winning Card

A winning Bingo card contains a line of 5 numbers that have all been called. 

Players normally record the numbers that have been called by crossing them out or marking them with a Bingo dauber. 

In this exercise we will mark that a number has been
called by replacing it with a 0 in the Bingo card dictionary.

Write a function that takes a dictionary representing a Bingo card as its only
parameter. 

If the card contains a line of five zeros (vertical, horizontal or diagonal) then your function should return True, indicating that the card has won. 

Otherwise the function should return False.

Create a main program that demonstrates your function by creating several Bingo cards, displaying them, and indicating whether or not they contain a winning line. 

You should demonstrate your function with at least one card with a horizontal line, at least one card with a vertical line, at least one card with a diagonal line, and at least one card that has some numbers crossed out but does not contain a winning line. 

You will probably want to import your solution to Exercise "Create a Bingo Card" when completing this exercise.
