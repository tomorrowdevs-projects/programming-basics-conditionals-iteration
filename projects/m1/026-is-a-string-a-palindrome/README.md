# Is a String a Palindrome?

A string is a palindrome if it is identical forward and backward. For example “anna”, “civic”, “level” and “hannah” are all examples of palindromic words. 

Write a program that reads a string from the user and uses a loop to determine whether or not it is a palindrome. 
Display the result, including a meaningful output message.

Aibohphobia is the extreme or irrational fear of palindromes. 
This word was constructed by prepending the -phobia suffix with it’s reverse, resulting in a palindrome. 
Ailihphilia is the fondness for or love of palindromes. It was constructed in the same manner from the -philia suffix.
